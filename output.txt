When I buy beef I always go for the best quality.
If I buy B-grade or C-grade meat I can taste the B-ness and the C-ness of it. I really just want to taste A-ness.

A bedraggled man with long, scraggly hair is jumping up and down next to a hole
He's shouting "17! 17! 17!"

An inquisitive onlooker watches him for a minute, then he inches  closer to the hole to peer in, he bends over to get a better view, and the old man kicks him in!

"18! 18! 18!"

A wife asks her husband to get her something that goes from 0 to 180 in just a few seconds...

He bought her a scale 😂

"What happened to you?"
"Months of meticulous planning. Specialists trained for this specific mission. Thousands of dollars of custom built equipment. ALL WORTHLESS! We were thwarted at the last moment and just barely escaped unscathed!"

"No, I mean why are you covered in aluminum?"

"I just told you, we were foiled!"

A man’s car broke down as he was driving past a beautiful old monastery
He walked up to the drive and knocked on the front door. A monk answered, listened to the man’s story, and graciously invited him to spend the night.

The monks fed him and led him to a tiny chamber in which to sleep. The man slept serenely until a strange and beautiful sound awakened him. The next morning, as the monks were repairing his car, he asked about the sound that had woke him. “We’re sorry,” the monks said. “We can’t tell you about the sound. You’re not a monk.”

Disappointed, the man went on his way and pondered the source of the alluring sound for several years. One day he again stopped at the monastery and explained to the monks that he had so enjoyed his previous stay. So he asked for permission to spend another night under their peaceful roof. Late that night, he again heard the strange, beautiful sound. The following morning he begged the monks to explain the sound but the monks gave him the same answer as before. “We’re sorry. We can’t tell you about the sound. You’re not a monk.”

By now the man’s curiosity had turned to obsession. He decided to give up everything to become a monk, for that was the only way he could learn about the sound. He informed the monks of his decision and began the long and arduous task of becoming one of them. Seventeen long years later, the man finally became a true member of the order. When the celebration ended, he humbly went to the leader of the order and asked to be told the source of the sound.

Silently, the old monk led the new monk to a huge wooden door. He opened the door with a golden key.

The door swung open to reveal a second door, this one of silver, then a third of gold, and so on. Until they had passed through twelve doors, each more magnificent than the last. The new monk’s face was awash with tears of joy as he finally beheld the wondrous source of the beautiful and mysterious sound he had heard so many years before. But I can’t tell you what it was because you’re not a monk.

A bunch of functions are drinking in bar...
When someone yells "A differential is coming!" All the functions panic and try to hide, except e^x . One of the functions asked "e^x , why aren't you hiding from the differential?" To which it responded "I'm e^x , a differential can't do anything to me!" At that point, the differential walked in and overheard e^x 's arrogant claims to which the differential said "Ah but you see, I differentiate with respect to **y**"

I'm not proud. Learned this from a TA in Diff Eq in college.

Severe Damnation
A Damned sees another Damned being brutally tortured in Hades. The first Damned says “Woah, what on Earth did you do?” The second Damned says “I stole bread.” Astonished, the first Damned says “Wait, that’s all? Why is your punishment so severe?” The second Damned smiled and replied “Before being cast down here, the God of the Underworld said I was going straight to Hades, and that’s when I grabbed my crotch and said “Ha-deez-NUTS!”

I hate it when my aunts and grannies come up to me at weddings and say "You're next."
So now I just do the same to them at funerals.
